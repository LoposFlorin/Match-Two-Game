<< Memory Tiles >>

How to play:

* click on any card to flip it over to see the symbol
* click on a second card to flip it
* if symbols match cards will remain flipped, if not they will flip back
* uncover all symbols to win the game


-- code along tutorial @freeCodeCamp / JS Tutorials --


Final part of tutorial will manage code refactoring.



** My own touch to develop the app further (add timer, more tiles, leaderboard ...), will be added at some point ಠ_ಠ **
